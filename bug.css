The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.my-class {
  color: red;
}

#my-id {
  color: green;
}

.my-class #my-id {
  color: purple;
}

#my-id.my-class {
  color: orange;
}

```

The unexpected behavior arises when an element has both the class `my-class` and the ID `my-id`.  The specificity rules in CSS dictate that the last selector (`#my-id.my-class`) is more specific than `.my-class #my-id` because it combines an ID and a class which beats an element selector plus a class selector.  Thus, the final color of the element will be orange, not purple, which is a less intuitive result for developers unfamiliar with CSS specificity.
