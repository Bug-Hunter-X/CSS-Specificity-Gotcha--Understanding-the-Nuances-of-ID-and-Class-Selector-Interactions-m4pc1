The solution involves carefully considering the order and structure of selectors. Instead of relying on complex combinations of selectors that can be difficult to debug and reason about, it's generally better to use more straightforward and explicit selectors.  Here is a cleaner version that may use more elements rather than relying on multiple classes and ID selectors:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.my-class {
  color: red;
}

#my-id {
  color: green;
}

.my-class#my-id {
  color: orange; /*If this is the desired color, then it is the most specific and will override the others*/
}

```

This approach simplifies the CSS and makes it easier to understand the style hierarchy.  If you must use the complex selector, make sure it is explicit and is exactly what you intend. If you intend to use a simpler style, using more elements is recommended.
